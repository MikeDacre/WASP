WASP: allele-specific pipeline for unbiased read mapping and molecular QTL discovery
----

This is a fork of the original by bmvdgeijn that is modular and thus easier to fashion into a pipeline.
I have converted it to python3, added documentation to the source code and help options to the scripts.
I have also moved all of the functions from the mapping/ folder into mapping.py

The scripts/ folder contains run scripts.

The mapping.py file contains functions for unbiased mapping of allele-specific reads.

The CHT directory contains source code for the Combined Haplotype Test.
